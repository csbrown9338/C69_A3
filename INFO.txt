General issues I had was wrapping my head around the structure. 
It took me about a week to somewhat grasp how the inodes and blocks interact with each other,
and that the ext2_dir_entry_2 structures were interpreted by the blocks at different offsets (depending on rec_len), and that only specifically inodes that
represent directories have these specific structures in their blocks to begin with.
It also took me a while to realize that the pointers in the superblock, block group, and inode structures (to stuff like the inode table, or the bitmaps)
work like indices and you have to index through the blocks to find its address.

Aside from my inability to grasp the structure in a timely manner (and by consequence, delaying the actual coding), a lot of issues I found were related to
the pickiness of the addresses (i.e. getting the address to the exact byte), which makes sense considering we are meant to be working with memory. However,
it has hindered my progress with several of the commands since it's difficult to pinpoint where in the code it failed to return the desired address,
and how the address was shifted in any way.

For all commands, functionalities (including helpers) I have completed:
    - The checks for the arguments
    - Checking the validity of a path
    - Checking if an inode points to a dir or not
    - Retrieving information from the superblock, block group, and inodes
    - Extracting the ext2_dir_entry_2 structure from the blocks given the inode, block index, and position

For the specific commands, I have completed the following:

ext2_ls:
    - Looping through the entries of a given directory and listing them

ext2_cp:

ext2_mkdir:

ext2_ln:

ext2_rm:
    - Nothing
